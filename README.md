# Analysis-Of-Palmer-Penguins-Dataset-Using-R

I have created this fun project as an assignment for Google data analytics certification course. I have used R programming language for exploration and visualization of Palmer Penguins data. 

## About the palmerpenguins dataset

It is a dataset comprising various measurements of three different penguin species, namely Adelie,
Gentoo, and Chinstrap. The rigorous study was conducted in the islands of the Palmer Archipelago,
Antarctica. These data were collected from 2007 to 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the Palmer
Station Long Term Ecological Research Program, part of the US Long Term Ecological Research
Network.

## Knowledge gain from this Project

- How to load necessary R packages like **'tidyverse'** and **'ggplot2'** for data analysis and visualization.
- How to perform exploratory data analysis using tidyverse functions to gain insights about dataset.
- How to used functions from ‘ggplot2’ to plot different interactive plots describing relationships among
variables.
- How to create presentable analysis report using R Markdown.
